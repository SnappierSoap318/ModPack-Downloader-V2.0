# ModPack-Downloader-V2.0
  This is a python based modpack downloader to download modpacks from curseforge, ie. an alternative to the curse launcher(now called Twitch Launcher).
  
  It was develeoped as a way to learn python by setting difficult tasks ahead and overcoming those, i have tried my best to impliment the use of modularisation and good code commenting to make the code as readable as possible and understandable.
  
  the old version had a lot of problems and had a very messy code base, so i thought of rewriting the entire program and make it better in the process.
  
  if you would like to addon to this project, do make a fork.
  
  i will try my best to keep this repo active and iron out the issues arising due to any errors as such,and i am willing to resolve them and update it asap. 
  
  
  AFAIK: This does only work on windows(i have not tested this on Linux so i dont know if this works or not)

# Changes From the Old Version: 
  Added a GUI
  Modularized the Code
  added Comments to the code for Better readabilty
  added option to Either add the modpack into the launcher or just Download 
  
  
 # Required Dependancies to Run this python file:
  ```
  Faster-than-requests
  PySimpleGUI==4.28.0
  ```
  
# Running The Code:
  ##### Hard Way(kind of):
   just open a command promt or powershell to the directory of the `.py` file and just run `python <file-name>.py` and it should show a GUI and the rest is self explanatory
  ##### Easy Way: 
   run the exe file provided in the releases page of this repo and thats it rest is self explanatory
