# ModPack-Downloader-V2.0
  This is a python based modpack downloader to download modpacks from curseforge, ie. an alternative to the curse launcher(now called Twitch Launcher).
  
  It was develeoped as a way to learn python by setting difficult tasks ahead and overcoming those, i have tried my best to impliment the use of modularisation and good code commenting to make the code as readable as possible and understandable.
  
  the old version had a lot of problems and had a very messy code base, so i thought of rewriting the entire program and make it better in the process.
  
  if you would like to addon to this project, do make a fork.
  
  i will try my best to keep this repo active and iron out the issues arising due to any errors as such,and i am willing to resolve them and update it asap. 
  
  
  AFAIK: This does only work on windows(i have not tested this on Linux so i dont know if this works or not)
